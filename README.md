# Statistical Inference – Notes and Scripts  
# Inferencia Estadística – Apuntes y Scripts

This repository contains **personal notes on Statistical Inference**, compiled to serve as a reference for theoretical concepts and practical applications. The notes cover fundamental and advanced topics in statistical inference, including estimation, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.

Additionally, **R and Python scripts** will be added over time to provide **practical examples** illustrating the concepts discussed in the notes.
